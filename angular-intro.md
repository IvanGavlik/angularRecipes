# What is Angular ?

A component-based framework
A collection of libraries (routing, forms, client-server communication...)

## Core ideas behind Angular
__Components__ are the building blocks that compose an application

* strong encapsulation
* intuitive application structure
* easier to unit test 

Every component has an HTML template that declares how that component renders.
You can add additional functionality to your templates through the use of __directives__.

__Dependency injection__ allows you to declare the dependencies of your TypeScript classes without taking care of their instantiation. Instead, Angular handles the instantiation for you.

__Angular CLI__ a valuable tool for building out your applications.

__Libs__

* Angular Forms
* Angular HttpClient
